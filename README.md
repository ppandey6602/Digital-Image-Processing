# Digital-Image-Processing
In this repository we contained the matlab code with the following functionalities:

1.) Reading an image

2.) Grey level transformations on a particular image

3.) Histogram equalization on an image

4.) Spatial distribution construction


Points to be considered: 

i) .mlx is the matlab online extension. So for viewing the file just download the raw files and upload them in the matlab online code area. 

ii) You can take any image and just upload it to in the coding area and modify the name of the image file accordingly.
