# Digital-Image-Processing
In this repository we contained the matlab code with the following functionalities:

1.) Reading an image

2.) Grey level transformations on a particular image

Enhancing an image provides better contrast and a more detailed image as compare to non enhanced image. Image enhancement has very applications. It is used to enhance medical images, images captured in remote sensing, images from satellite e.t.c

The transformation function has been given below

s = T ( r )

where r is the pixels of the input image and s is the pixels of the output image. T is a transformation function that maps each value of r to each value of s. Image enhancement can be done through gray level transformations which are discussed below.

3.) Histogram equalization on an image

4.) Spatial distribution construction



Points to be considered: 

i) .mlx is the matlab online extension. So for viewing the file just download the raw files and upload them in the matlab online code area. 

ii) You can take any image and just upload it to in the coding area and modify the name of the image file accordingly.
